 * This Tetris game is under the name of Simo-Tetris. UI includes game logo, game
 * scene (place where the tetrominos drop), textbox for printing motivational
 * texts to the player after breaking rows, highscore-table for printing the
 * top three players of all time and a login spot, where you can choose your
 * nickname for the scoredata after losing, which prints out if you made it to
 * the top three players of all time.
 *
 * UI includes three main buttons:
 * login-button, start-button, reset-button and quit-button.
 *
 * login-button: You need to first login with your nickname before starting game
 * (for saving your top score).
 *
 * start-button: Game starts, only if you have logged in before pressing. Type your name in the
 * textbox and press login-button, and after that you are able to start the game.
 * Clock starts rolling and tetrominos dropping.
 *
 * reset-button: Resets the game whenever pressed. Score goes to zero and your score will NOT be
 * saved to highscoredata.
 *
 * quit-button: Terminates the game.
 *
 *
 * Game rules:
 * You need to collect as much points as possible by getting full horizontal rows.
 * If your "Tetris tower" builds up to the top, you have lost.
 * The dropping speed accelerates every 10 breaked rows, and your level rises by one.
 * When the droppingspeed accelerates, you get more points for a breaked row.
 *
 * You can move your tetromino with next key presses:
 * A - Moves your tetromino one step right.
 * D - Moves your tetromino one step left.
 * S - Moves your tetromino one step down (for making the block drop faster).
 * W - Rotates your tetromino IF there is space for rotation.
 *
 * Tetromino cant go outside the scene.
 *
 * There are 7 different tetrominotypes, which spawn randomly:
 * Square, horizontal, step to left, step to right, left corner, right corner,
 * and pyramid, with a color from red, green, blue and white (random).
 *
 * SPECIAL RULES:
 * You can rotate the leftstep and rightstep tetrominos the same way.
 * This makes the game a bit easier and is separates this Simo-Tetris from
 * the basic, boring tetris.
